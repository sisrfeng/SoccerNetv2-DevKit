## Camera Calibration and Player Localization: [Top View](CALF_Calibration) / [GCN](CALF_Calibration_GCN)

    This is the code for the paper
    [Camera Calibration and  Player Localization in SoccerNet-v2 and  Investigation of their Representations for Action Spotting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09333.pdf)
    (CVSports2021),
    that leverages field and  players localization for action spotting.

## [Temporally Aware Pooling](TemporallyAwarePooling): NetVLAD++

    This is the code for the paper [Temporally-Aware Feature Pooling for Action Spotting in Video Broadcasts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06779.pdf) (CVSports2021),
    that introduces the baseline NetVLAD++,
    among other temporally-aware feature pooling modules.

## [CALF](CALF): A Context-Aware Loss Function for Action Spotting in Soccer Videos 

    A custom loss function is used to
    explicitly model the temporal context around action spots.
    The main idea behind this loss  is to
        penalize the frames far-distant from the action and
        steadily decrease the penalty for the frames gradually closer to the action.
        The frames just before the action
            are not penalized to
            avoid providing misleading information
            as its occurrence is uncertain.
    However,
        those just after the action are heavily penalized
        as we know for sure that the action has occurred.

## [Pool](Pool): NetVLAD and MaxPool

    Those baseline are based on
    the pooling methods for action spotting introduced in the original [SoccerNet](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w34/Giancola_SoccerNet_A_Scalable_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)
    dataset.
